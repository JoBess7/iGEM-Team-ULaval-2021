## Team ULaval's Contribution
In 2021, Laval University took part in the competition. Our team tackled a very important issue for maple syrup producers: **ropy syrup**. In short, when maple syrup comes in contact with bacteria, it creates ropy syrup, a type of maple syrup which cannot be sold. The team developped a treatment to put into the barrels of ropy syrup to make it usable again for producers.
