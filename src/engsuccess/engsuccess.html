                        our project, we used the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle (DBTL cycle) proposed to us by one of our
                        mentors, Michel Guertin. This strategy follows four steps: (1) the Design phase is where we
                        define the problem, propose multiple solutions and identify the biological components to
                        construct; (2) the Build phase is where we synthesise, assemble and/or edit the components; (3)
                        the Test phase is where we characterise all the components we build to identify the ones that
                        work best and (4) the Learn phase that allows us to analyse all the data generated to start the
                        next DBTL cycle. Last year, we did not have access to the laboratories, so we concentrated all
                        of our energy into the design and build part of our project. This year, we put emphasis on the
                        build, test and learning phases to improve our solution. This section summarizes what we did
                        last year and what we have done this year.

                            Last year, one of our members, Benjamin Ouellet, suggested that we work on maple syrup as it
                            is an important part of our economy and our culture in Canada. After meeting and discussing
                            with experts in the field such as Marie Filteau, Luc Lagacé, Vincent Poisson and Jean-Michel
                            Lavoie, we decided to work on ropy syrup, a kind of maple syrup with high concentration of
                            dextrans causing viscosity<sup>3</sup>. Since it is classified as a flavor defect in
                            Quebec’s
                            legislation, it needs to be destroyed<sup>4</sup>. This causes food waste, in addition to
                            energy and
                            economical losses for maple syrup producers.
                            <br><br>
                            These dextrans are exopolysaccharides produced by bacteria that come from the environment
                            and are introduced in the tubing system during maple sap collection<sup>3</sup>. These
                            dextrans then
                            cause maple syrup to have a ropy and viscous texture3. Up to now, there is no way to detect
                            if maple saps are contaminated with dextrans. Thus, the ropiness of the syrup causes damage
                            to expensive equipment.
                            <br><br>
                            The solution we developed to solve this problem is a treatment using an enzyme, a
                            dextranase, to degrade the dextrans polymers<sup>5</sup>. We then decided that it is best
                            for our treatment to be used after the evaporation process, when the ropy syrup is already
                            produced, so only the ropy syrup gets the treatment and the rest of the maple syrup
                            production stays untouched. For the dextranase, there are specific conditions in which the
                            enzyme needs to be active : high viscosity, low temperature and slightly acidic
                            pH<sup>3,6</sup>.

                            Last year, our team was able to find one dextranase candidate expressed in <span
                                class="italic">Gelidibacter
                                algens.</span> We choose this dextranase because its properties could fit with the
                            expected
                            experimental conditions in ropy maple syrup. Also, discussions with Marie-Ève Picard, a
                            member of a professor’s lab here at the university, helped us decide to use pET-28a as an
                            expression vector for both the dextranase. It is an expression vector for <span
                                class="italic">Escherichia coli</span>
                            strains so we choose to use a codon optimized sequence of the dextranase in <span
                                class="italic">E. coli</span>
                            Furthermore, we looked through the literature to find previous experiments on expression and
                            purification of dextranases. We found that the dextranase of <span class="italic">S.
                                mutans</span> showed proteolysis
                            during those experiments<sup>1</sup> and that this modification enhanced its activity. The
                            authors
                            identified the protein segments to remove from the enzyme to gain activity. Using sequence
                            alignment, we were able to evaluate the segments we needed to remove from the <span
                                class="italic">G. algens.</span>
                            dextranase and designed the part accordingly.

                            <br>As planned last year, we ordered our dextranase expression vectors through Twist

                            the sequencing confirmed that the sequence corresponded to our design, the pET28a-G.algens

                            The first step to test our part was to successfully express the enzyme in our induction
                            system. To do so, we performed an experiment to optimize the expression of our protein by
                            testing multiple induction conditions. The samples that showed the largest expression of
                            protein were then sonicated to verify if the dextranase was soluble. By those experiments,
                            we showed that the dextranase of <span class="italic">G. algens</span> was best expressed
                            and showed higher solubility
                            under the following induction condition: 18 hours of induction with 1mM IPTG at 18C. Also,
                            after a quick purification test, we knew that the protein could be successfully purified. We
                            used these first purified samples to perform a Nelson-Somogyi assay allowing us to determine
                            if the dextranase was still active. We were thrilled to see that the enzyme was able to
                            degrade dextran even after the whole purification protocol. To our knowledge, it was the
                            first time the <span class="italic">G. algens</span> dextranase was successfully expressed
                            and purified.
                            <br><br>
                            The second step was to purify a large amount of our enzyme to do the enzymatic and
                            rheological assays. We used the determined optimized condition to perform the expression and
                            the purification of the dextranase. Indeed, we obtained a high concentration (636uM) of
                            purified protein in our 15mL sample. This was largely enough for our needs so we moved
                            forward with the enzymatic assays.
                            <br><br>
                            For the enzymatic assays, we used a miniaturized version of the Nelson-Somogyi protocol
                            allowing us to use less dextranase for each reaction<sup>2</sup>. Because no experimental
                            data was
                            available on the properties of this enzyme, we tested the activity and the stability of the
                            dextranase at various temperatures and pH on dextrans of 3 different molecular weights. We
                            found that the stability and activity are not really affected by the range of pH that we
                            tested (5.5-7) and that the dextranase does not seem to have a prefered dextran weight for
                            its activity. However, the temperature seems to impact the activity and the stability of the
                            dextranase. Surprisingly, the optimal activity was observed at 40°C although the optimal
                            stability is measured at 18°C. We also tested our dextranase directly in the ropy syrup at
                            room temperature. We saw a decrease in the viscosity of the sample treated with the
                            dextranase compared to the control. This observation was only visual, so we wanted to add
                            some quantitative data to prove the efficiency of our treatment.
                            <br><br>
                            We used a rheometer to collect the quantitative data on our dextranase treatment. We
                            measured the viscosity of a ropy maple syrup sample and compared it to the treated ropy
                            syrup at 20°C. It showed a decrease in viscosity, however this decrease was found very
                            similar to the one caused only by the dilution of the ropy syrup with the buffer. We know
                            that our enzymatic treatment will be applied at a lower temperature so we also tested the
                            effect of the dextranase at 10°C. The treatment caused a better relative decay of viscosity
                            at this temperature. It is explained by the fact that the sample viscosity increases
                            exponentially with the diminution of the sample temperature.

                            <br>
                            From our analysed data, we conclude that our expression vector and strategy worked
                            efficiently. Also, the approach for protein purification was successful. However, the
                            properties of the G. algens dextranase were not what we expected. Indeed, we expected that
                            its activity would be maximal at a temperature around 10-15°C, but we showed that it was
                            around 40°C. Therefore, the dextranase treatment is not at its maximal potential at the
                            conservation temperature of maple syrup. On the other hand, we learned that maple syrup with
                            food additives would never be sold as maple syrup. We were already reflecting on the
                            possibility of producing other sugar bases with the product of our treated ropy syrup. Thus,
                            there is no relevance of keeping the enzymatic treatment at a low temperature(preservation
                            of maple syrup). It is very convenient because our enzyme is more active at higher
                            temperatures.
                            <br><br>
                            Due to time constraints, we were not able to perform all rheological tests we wanted. So
                            there is a lack of information about the impact of the dextranase on the ropy syrup for
                            longer incubation time and for wider temperature range. Nevertheless, we saw that the G.
                            algens dextranase is active and accomplishes its purpose. We also observed that the dilution
                            factor induced when we add the treatment to the syrup is quite high and it makes it
                            difficult to measure the treatment effect at room temperature. To improve the treatment, we
                            could concentrate the enzyme to add the same quantity of dextranase without diluting the
                            sample as much.
