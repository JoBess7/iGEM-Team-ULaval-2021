                            Team iGEM Concordia_Montreal is the team we’ve collaborated with the most over the years.
                            For our third year in a row collaborating with them, we planned a two-part endeavour: an
                            online bulletin board describing inspiring women in STEM from across the world and a
                            workshop to promote diversity and inclusion in STEM. This bulletin board, later named The
                            Rosalind Chronicles, was the first part we worked on.
                            <br><br>
                            The project first started as a collaboration with Team iGEM Concordia_Montreal exclusively,
                            but it soon grew into a four-team endeavor. After starting to promote it online on the iGEM
                            Global Slack workspace, a member of our team noticed that two other iGEM teams were
                            organising a similar collaboration two days later: Teams Patras and Thessaloniki. Seeing the
                            perfect opportunity to grow this collaboration, we contacted them.
                            <br><br>That’s how, as a final group of 4 teams, we created together the collaborative
                            bulletin board shown in the video below. Through this collaboration, we invited other iGEM
                            teams to submit a short description of a woman in STEM from their country, as well as a
                            photo of the women in their teams. A total of 26 teams ended up participating, sending in
                            short biographies of their chosen STEM women. After gathering all this information, we
                            created the interactive online bulletin board shown in the following video:<br><br><br>

                            </div>When our team and Team Concordia joined forces with teams Patras and Thessaloniki for
                            our bulletin board, we agreed to work on this workshop together as well. WiSTEM, an
                            AfteriGEM organisation, helped us with the introduction to our event. On top of that, Eve
                            Langelier, head of Canada’s Chair of women in science and engineering, gave us essential
                            feedback on what we had planned for our workshop. She also gave us valuable informative
                            resources to share with our attendees.
                            <br><br>Together, we created and conducted this online workshop. Half of it focused on
                            increasing diversity and inclusion in research and iGEM teams and the other half focused
                            more on encouraging women in STEM. Our <a

                                page</a> explains the educational contents of the presentation more in detail.


                            <br><br>Our workshop took place on September 16th 2021 via Zoom and around 25 people
                            attended. We gave the attendees the ressources Eve Langelier shared with us and they gave us
                            very positive feedback on the workshop after it ended.

                                    JulyGEM is a yearly event organised by Team iGEM Calgary which allows teams to tune
                                    in to workshops about science communication, entrepreneurship, and human practices.
                                    They also allow teams to participate in pitch sessions, quick, 5-minute
                                    presentations about their project followed by questions from judges and feedback
                                    from other iGEM teams and the judges themselves.

                                    Given that this presentation was essential for our project last year, we decided to
                                    participate again. Even if our project is the same as last year’s, we were still
                                    able to give more information and context to attendees on our project and the
                                    questions from the judges were very useful, especially for the legal considerations
                                    of our project. This was the perfect opportunity to meet new iGEM teams and to learn
                                    more about what their projects are about this year.

                                    pictures of monuments in the city, post the images on instagram with information on
                                    the monuments, and then challenge other teams to participate. Our team was
                                    challenged by Team iGEM Sorbonne, so three of our team members adventured into
                                    Quebec City to show off four of its famous monuments, standing in the only fortified

                                    kinds of designs, suggesting anything from promoting our own project to simplifying
                                    an interesting science concept and every fun design in between. We decided we wanted

                            Team iGEM Concordia_Montreal is the team we’ve collaborated with the most over the years.
                            For our third year in a row collaborating with them, we planned a two-part endeavour: an
                            online bulletin board describing inspiring women in STEM from across the world and a
                            workshop to promote diversity and inclusion in STEM. This bulletin board, later named The
                            Rosalind Chronicles, was the first part we worked on.
                            <br><br>
                            The project first started as a collaboration with Team iGEM Concordia_Montreal exclusively,
                            but it soon grew into a four-team endeavor. After starting to promote it online on the iGEM
                            Global Slack workspace, a member of our team noticed that two other iGEM teams were
                            organising a similar collaboration two days later: Teams Patras and Thessaloniki. Seeing the
                            perfect opportunity to grow this collaboration, we contacted them.
                            <br><br>That’s how, as a final group of 4 teams, we created together the collaborative
                            bulletin board shown in the video below. Through this collaboration, we invited other iGEM
                            teams to submit a short description of a woman in STEM from their country, as well as a
                            photo of the women in their teams. A total of 26 teams ended up participating, sending in
                            short biographies of their chosen STEM women. After gathering all this information, we
                            created the interactive online bulletin board shown in the following video:<br><br><br>

                            our bulletin board, we agreed to work on this workshop together as well. WiSTEM, an
                            AfteriGEM organisation, helped us with the introduction to our event. On top of that, Eve
                            Langelier, head of Canada’s Chair of women in science and engineering, gave us essential
                            feedback on what we had planned for our workshop. She also gave us valuable informative
                            resources to share with our attendees.
                            <br><br>Together, we created and conducted this online workshop. Half of it focused on
                            increasing diversity and inclusion in research and iGEM teams and the other half focused
                            more on encouraging women in STEM. Our <a

                            <br><br>Our workshop took place on September 16th 2021 via Zoom and around 25 people
                            attended. We gave the attendees the ressources Eve Langelier shared with us and they gave us
                            very positive feedback on the workshop after it ended.

                                    JulyGEM is a yearly event organised by Team iGEM Calgary which allows teams to tune
                                    in to workshops about science communication, entrepreneurship, and human practices.
                                    They also allow teams to participate in pitch sessions, quick, 5-minute
                                    presentations about their project followed by questions from judges and feedback
                                    from other iGEM teams and the judges themselves.

                                    Given that this presentation was essential for our project last year, we decided to
                                    participate again. Even if our project is the same as last year’s, we were still
                                    able to give more information and context to attendees on our project and the
                                    questions from the judges were very useful, especially for the legal considerations
                                    of our project. This was the perfect opportunity to meet new iGEM teams and to learn
                                    more about what their projects are about this year.

                                    pictures of monuments in the city, post the images on instagram with information on
                                    the monuments, and then challenge other teams to participate. Our team was
                                    challenged by Team iGEM Sorbonne, so three of our team members adventured into
                                    Quebec City to show off four of its famous monuments, standing in the only fortified

                                    an interesting science concept and every fun design in between. We decided we wanted
