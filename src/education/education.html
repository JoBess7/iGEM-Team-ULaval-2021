                        <br><br>
                        In a few days, on October 26th, we will be hosting a workshop for around 20 to 30 children aged 8 to 12 to share the power of biotechnology. This workshop is organised for the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) club from the Morrin Centre, here in Quebec City, Canada. 
                        <br><br>
                        The Morrin Centre is an English cultural centre managed by Canada’s oldest learning society. They organise many activities for the anglophone community in Quebec City, such as concerts, writing activities, readings and activities for children, including the STEAM club.
                        This club organises a one-hour activity each week to explore different science and artistic themes while promoting creativity, thinking, perseverance. 
                        <br><br>
                        Because of the pandemic, we will have to host our workshop through zoom, which will be a challenge because our target audience is quite young. Thus, we are making a workshop that is as interactive as possible  and encourages excitement and engagement with the subject matter. This also helps the children remember information better.
                        <br><br>
                        The title of our presentation is “Create your own hero using biotechnology” and through this workshop we will introduce the children to what biothech is and how it is used to solve important issues. They will be able to express their creativity by drawing and inventing microorganisms with specific “powers” to solve an issue that interests them. 
                        <br><br>
                        With this “choose your own adventure” format, we encourage children to interact with the presentation, us and with each other. This will allow teamwork, communication, creativity and thinking, such as encouraged by the club. We don’t expect to share this event on social media to make it available for a broader audience, but we hope that by planning this event, we will want to organise more workshops for children on biotechnology.
                        <br><br>
                        Even if we haven’t presented our workshop yet, our team learned some important lessons on science communication. First, this was the first time that our team members organized a sci comm event for children, which was a challenge because we are more used to presenting to an audience with a general  knowledge of biology. We also learned on how to make presentations as interactive as possible, given our target audience. Finally, even if we haven’t gotten feedback from our workshop, we were inspired by what our team did in 2019 with the STEAM club in 2019 to ensure a good presentation format.

                        Earlier in the year, Genscript approached us for a quick interview of our project, which was done through a recorder zoom interview. Our target audience was the general science community and people who are familiar with Genscript, given that the video was shared on their Youtube channel. This allowed us to promote our project to a broader community, outside of iGEM. We hope that this interview will spark curiosity for a few people to check our socials and our wiki and learn new applications of synthetic biology.

                        This was a new challenge for our team members because it was the first time we were formally interviewed like this. We had to learn how to describe our project on the spot, without knowing the questions beforehand. We also had to make sure our answers were well explained and understandable by a broad audience who knows nothing about our project.

                        This collaboration brought our biggest communication event this iGEM year. With three other iGEM teams, Team Concordia-Montreal, Team Patras and Team Thessaloniki, we collaborated to highlight how women impact STEM and promote diversity and inclusion in STEM. We created two communication materials : a virtual billboard and a workshop.

                            This virtual billboard allowed around 26 iGEM teams to submit a short bibliography from a woman in STEM from their country that inspires them. We also wanted to encourage and promote incoming women in STEM by letting teams submit a photo of women in their iGEM team.
                            <br><br>
                            We decided to create a virtual billboard because we wanted to use a platform that is interactive, to change from something more formal like a PDF. We hope that this format helps iGEM teams reflect on inspiring women in STEM in their country. We also hope that this allows teams to discover women in STEM throughout the world.
                            <br><br>
                            For this format, our main audience is other iGEM teams but by sharing our billboard on social media we hope to make this material accessible to a broader audience. 
                            This new interactive format encourages an indirect dialogue between teams, allowing them to write about inspiring women in STEM.

                            This communication event allowed all four teams to learn a lot! We learned about a whole new form of communication, which is very different from what we learn in science. As well, we learned a lot from other teams and we are proud to do a part in promoting women in STEM.

                            <span class='subtitle'>Women in STEM - Diversity and Inclusion Workshop</span>
                            <br><br>
                            During this workshop, our introduction focused on describing the Matilda effect. This term, coined by Margaret Rossiter, historian, describes the tendency of women’s research in STEM to be taken by men for their own credit. 
                            <br><br>
                            Next, half of our presentation focused on women in STEM throughout history. We presented quick biographies of women from the 19th century to today. In this segment, we described their work and talked about how the Mathilda effect affected the credit they received. In the second segment, we informed listeners on how to make research and iGEM teams more diverse and inclusive. We defined these terms, explained their differences and similarities and defined cognitive dissonance and how it is implicated in the avoidance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace and in our society.
                            <br><br>
                            Given that we wanted to invite a dialogue between the scientific and iGEM communities and our teams, we decided to host this workshop on zoom and encourage people to ask questions and start a dialogue. To keep the conversation going, we gave the audience a plethora of resources that discuss diversity and inclusion inside and outside STEM. We hope that these resources will allow people to reflect on their experiences with diversity and inclusion and explore how they can make a space more diverse and inclusive. Also, to make this subject available to a broader audience, we shared our presentation on social media.
                            <br><br>
                            Organising this workshop allowed our team to learn a lot about communication and event organisation. This was the first time that the team members organising this presentation managed the promotion, planification and other technical aspects of a workshop. We also learned teamwork at a distance, given that our four teams had very different time zones. Thus, we had to plan our meetings and promotion accordingly.  Finally, all four teams and their members learned a lot about diversity and inclusion in STEM and we also learned about women’s representation in STEM and how it has changed throughout time.
