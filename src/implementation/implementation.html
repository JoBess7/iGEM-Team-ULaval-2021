                        In Quebec, maple syrup production is regulated by government agencies like the Ministère de
                        l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation (in french, meaning Ministry of Agriculture,
                        Fishing and Food, aka MAPAQ). Quality testing and distribution of maple syrup, on the other
                        hand, is defined and organised by a large private association of maple producers, the
                        Producteurs et Productrices acéricoles du Québec (in french, meaning Maple Producers of Quebec,
                        aka PPAQ). Throughout the project, we collaborated with those organizations to ensure that our
                        enzymatic treatment could be easily incorporated into the maple syrup production process. It was
                        also to make sure that we created a solution that respected all the necessary regulations.

                        <br>
                        In Quebec, the PPAQ take care of acquiring every maple syrup barrel produced so they can test it
                        to ensure its quality. This barrel can have one of two fates: the PPAQ can either destroy it (if
                        it doesn’t fit the quality criteria) or sell it (if its quality is verified). Ropy maple syrup
                        doesn’t pass their viscosity test.
                        <br><br>
                        When the PPAQ tests viscosity, they check the “filament” that maple syrup makes. When this
                        filament is over 10 cm, the maple syrup is considered ropy and is stored in warehouses until it
                        is eventually destroyed, causing economic losses to maple syrup producers who have to pay for
                        this storage and destruction.
                        <br><br>
                        After some discussions with the PPAQ, <span class="bold">we found out there is currently no test
                            that shows which
                            maple sap will turn into ropy maple syrup</span> at the end of the transformation process.
                        On top of
                        that, maple syrup, as it is defined by the PPAQ, needs to be 100% pure, without any
                        adulteration<sup>1</sup>. The addition of our enzymatic treatment to the ropy syrup is
                        considered an
                        adulteration, so treated ropy syrup can only be considered and sold as a derivative maple
                        product.
                        <br><br>
                        Without being able to detect future ropiness from the sap, and with this strict definition of
                        maple syrup, we knew that we had to design our treatment to target the barrels, to avoid extra
                        losses from wrongly targeting sap. We decided to create our treatment for it to only be applied
                        to the ropy syrup that has already been produced, and that is therefore already stored by the
                        <span class="bold">PPAQ, our proposed end user for aSAP itself.</span>

                        <br>
                        Our enzymatic treatment has been designed on purpose so the enzyme would be active at the
                        storage condition of these warehouses. The solution containing the enzyme (dextranase) can
                        easily be produced (see <a href="" class="linker">Results</a>) and be added to the barrel to
                        break down the dextrans and lower
                        the viscosity of the syrup. Since ropy syrup is very viscous, we tried to make our solution as
                        effective as possible: our enzyme solution should be homogeneous in the ropy syrup. To answer
                        this problem, we simulated how we will administer our enzyme solution to the barrel (see <a
                            href="" class="linker">Modeling</a>).

                        <br>
                        While the PPAQ would be the proposed end users of our enzymatic treatment itself, we also looked
                        into potential end users of the product it created. That is why, during our project, we also
                        kept contact with the MAPAQ to know more about food regulation and how we can market our
                        derivative maple product.
                        <br><br>
                        For our treated syrup to be considered edible, the dextranase has to be authorized by Canada
                        Health as a food additive. As of now, many enzymes are already authorized in various food
                        products. For example, lysozymes are accepted in cheese and amylase are accepted in beer, wine
                        and even chocolate syrup<sup>2</sup>. We also looked if dextranase is already used in food. We
                        found that
                        there was dextranase used in toothpaste to prevent dental caries<sup>3</sup> and used in the
                        sugar cane
                        industry<sup>4</sup>.
                        <br><br>
                        We are confident that our enzyme could be accepted as a food additive by the MAPAQ. Even if it
                        cannot be accepted as a food product, we also thought about alternative industries, like
                        cosmetic products or food for animals, etc.

                        </a>
                        Another aspect to consider when looking into whether or not our end product is edible is the
                        fact that dextrans are produced by bacteria. Ropy syrup is currently considered as being
                        contaminated by bacteria by the MAPAQ regulations. That’s why we also decided to characterize
                        the microbiota of the ropy syrup. Even though we couldn’t identify toxin producing
                        microorganisms, we hope that our research could help futur experts.

                        <br>
                        When dealing with synthetic biology and food, an extra challenge lies in people’s acceptance of
                        it, both producers and consumers. To ensure an easy implementation, we also wanted to know if
                        our solution would be accepted and used by the community of maple syrup producers.
                        <br><br>
                        To this end, in 2020, we conducted a <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:ULaval/Human_Practices"
                            class="linker">survey</a> to know if maple syrup
                        producers would be interested
                        in this treatment being used on ropy syrup. The results of the survey suggested that producers
                        mostly sought alternatives for flavor defects, and that they were particularly open to the idea
                        of an enzymatic treatment for ropy syrup.

                            <li>The majority of producers are asking for more investment in research to solve the
                                problem of poor quality syrup.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        This year, we surveyed consumers. The results of this survey were mixed, but we remain
                        optimistic: while consumers would accept the final product more if there was no trace left of
                        the dextranase used to thin it out, they still think that solving this issue for maple producers
                        is an important endeavour.
