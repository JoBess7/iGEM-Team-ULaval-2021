                                micro-SNT enzymatic assays with the previously purified dextranase to characterize its
                                main properties as pH and temperature for optimal activity. Finally, rheological assays
                                allowed us to quantify the activity of our dextranase in ropy syrup, an essential test
                                for the proof of concept for this project. As a part of our contribution to a registry

                                    increase in expression through induction time and the effect of temperature and IPTG
                                    concentration on expression. The induction conditions in which the expression was

                            <span class="line-height">First, the optimal expression’s condition for the dextranase from
                                G. algens is at a concentration of 0.4 mM or 1mM of IPTG and at an incubation
                                temperature of 18 °C for 18 hours of induction. The increase of expression over
                                induction time is revealed by the increase of the protein band corresponding to the
                                expected weight of the G.algens’ dextranase of 63,5 kDa. We observe that the expression
                                of the protein is similar in every condition at 37°C, even if there is no inductor in
                                the medium. This can be explained by the basal rate of expression of the BL21
                                strain<sup>1</sup>.
                                Indeed, the bacteria can express the protein on the expression vector without the
                                inductor agent but at a low rate. Therefore, we can deduce that 37°C with IPTG is not
                                optimal conditions for the surexpression because the expression rate is similar to the
                                basal rate of the strain. The maximal expression observed in our experiment is at an
                                incubation temperature of 18°C. The lower temperature slowed the growth of E. coli, but
                                allowed a greater expression of the dextranase because it reduces synthesis rate thus
                                allowing the protein time to fold properly and avoiding aggregation<sup>2</sup>.
                                Moreover, another
                                way to explain the increase of expression at 18°C is the nature of <span
                                    class="italic">G. algens</span> which is a
                                psychrophilic bacteria. The optimal growth temperature for <span class="italic">G.
                                    algens</span> is from 10°C to
                                12°C <sup>3</sup>, therefore the induction temperature of 18°C is closer to the native
                                temperature
                                in which the dextranase is naturally expressed. In order to determine which condition
                                between 0.4mM and 1mM of IPTG is the best for induction, we performed a migration of the
                                soluble fractions and those results will be discussed later.</span>

                                mutans with the pET28 vector in BL21 strain. It appears that the optimal expression
                                conditions for this protein could be at 1mM IPTG, 37°C for 3.5h or at 0.4/1mM IPTG at
                                18°C for 18h. However, the Comassi staining reaches saturation quickly, so we can not
                                tell with certainty which condition is the best for expression, because the 3 conditions
                                described above showed similar staining. For that reason, we have chosen to pursue the
                                expression’s condition of 0.4mM and 1mM IPTG at 18°C for 18h. As expected, we observe a
                                protein band at the expected molecular weight for this protein (95,4 kDa), but we also
                                see a lower weight band appear with the induction which could indicate protein
                                degradation. The degradation is more important at 18°C. To investigate this result, we
                                looked into the literature, because this protein had already been expressed and purified
                                prior to our experiments. In fact, this degradation was also observed by Kim et al.,
                                2011 <sup>4</sup>. They also report that the catalytic activity of both fragments is
                                still active.
                                Thus, we moved forward with the sonication and the purification for both dextranases.

                                    the soluble fraction induced with 0.4mM and 1mM IPTG to verify which allows a higher
                                    concentration of the soluble enzyme. We observed that the 1mM condition confears a
                                    larger amount of dextranase in the soluble fraction. B. Gel showing the steps of

                            <span class="line-height">As mentioned above, we used the cell pellets collected from the
                                optimization experiment (0.4mM & 1mM, 18°C T18) to perform sonication in order to assess
                                the solubility of the <span class="italic">G. algens</span> dextranase for both
                                conditions. In Figure 4A, we observe
                                that a larger amount of protein in the soluble fraction is visible for the 1mM condition
                                than for the 0.4mM condition. The difference between those conditions is the
                                concentration of IPTG, so we can believe that the higher concentration induced a larger
                                production of proteins that was not visible with the total extracts due to the Coomassie
                                staining saturation. With the soluble fraction of the protein expressed at 1mM IPTG 18°C
                                for 18 hours, we did a first test of purification with IMAC chromatography(Figure 4B).
                                The SDS-PAGE revealed a high quality purification of our protein even if there is a loss
                                of dextranase during elution and washing. After all those verification steps, we
                                performed the expression experiment of <span class="italic">G. algens</span> dextranase
                                with the optimal condition
                                (Figure 3) at a larger scale in order to produce an important amount of dextranase. The
                                purity of this purification was similar to the one shown in Figure 4B, but for a higher
                                amount of proteins. Then, we quantified the concentration of purified protein with a
                                Bradford assay. We obtained a concentration of 4.01ug/uL of protein which equals to a
                                concentration of 636uM of the G.algens dextranase in our 15mL purified sample. We had
                                enough proteins to start the enzymatic assays. To our knowledge, this is the first time
                                the dextranase of <span class="italic">G. algens</span> is successfully expressed and

                                using a commercially available dextranase from Penicllium sp. (results not shown). We
                                were able to confirm the linearity of the assay between 0.008 and 0.072 µmole of glucose
                                equivalent as previously shown by Borkowska et al. <sup>5</sup>. With the protocol

                                functional, we measure the number of enzymatic units of the dextranase from <span

                                It revealed that for the equivalent of 0.002 µmole of dextranase, on the basis of amount
                                of protein after purification, has 0.01 U at pH 6.5 and 18 °C. Here, the 1 U is equal to
                                the release of 1 µmole of glucose equivalent after 1 min. This result show that the

                                the temperature optimum for the activity of the enzyme is at 40 °C (Figure 6A). Since
                                the treatment that we propose would be implemented at temperature between 15 and 20 °C
                                (see <a class="implement"
                                    href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:ULaval/Implementation">implementation</a>), we can
                                see that even though the activity is about one third of the
                                activity at 40 °C, the enzyme is still very active. This suggests that, however the
                                enzyme will not degrade the dextran at full capacity, this activity could be enough to
                                significantly reduce the viscosity of ropy maple syrup to something comparable to maple
                                syrup on an extended duration of treatment. After 15 min of incubation at each
                                temperature followed by enzymatic assay at 18 °C for 5 min, we measured that the enzyme
                                is at its highest stability at 15 °C and lower (considering the aberrant stability at 10
                                and 5 °C) (Figure 6B). This suggests that keeping the enzyme at 4 °C is enough to
                                conserve its stability, which is promising for further uses in industry without
                                requiring specific and costly conservation conditions. This also shows that a treatment
                                between 15 and 20 °C would be possible knowing that the enzyme would be close or at its
                                peak stability but with an activity about one third of its maximum, which is not

                                    The assays were performed at 20 °C and 10 °C with prior incubation of the ropy syrup
                                    with the dextranase. The control of the viscosimetric measurement was done with the
                                    same amount of buffer added to the ropy syrup. At 20 °C, the ropy syrup with buffer
                                    and dextranase have respectively a viscosity of 0.25 Pa s and 0.22 Pa s. The ropy
                                    syrup alone increases in viscosity with increasing fluctuations during the sampling
                                    time. At 10 °C, the ropy syrup with buffer and dextranase have respectively a
                                    viscosity of 0.47 Pa s and 0.42 Pa s. </div>

                            <span class="line-height">To measure the reduction of viscosity, we incubated prior to the
                                analyses ropy maple syrup with the dextranase at 35.5 µM for 50 minutes at ambient
                                temperature. In comparison with the measured viscosity of ropy maple syrup with added
                                buffer (Figure 7), we can see that the sample of ropy syrup under the action of the
                                dextranase has a decreased viscosity when measured at 20 °C (Figure 6A). This suggests
                                that not only the enzyme is active in ropy maple as estimated by the enzymatic assays,
                                but the enzyme is able to significantly reduce its viscosity. To have a better view of
                                the viscosity reduction after incubation since the relation between viscosity and
                                temperature is exponential <sup>7</sup>, we have done the same analysis at 10 °C with a
                                prior
                                incubation this time for 25 min at ambient temperature (Figure 6B). Again, we observed
                                that treated ropy maple syrup shows a reduced viscosity compared to ropy maple syrup
                                with buffer. This makes the proof of concept of our project, which is to reduce the
                                viscosity of ropy syrup for it to be used as a sugar base.</span>

                            <span class="line-height">Interestingly, when measuring the viscosity of ropy syrup alone
                                (Figure 6A), we observed that the viscosity increases during the sampling time with more
                                important fluctuations. We thought that the high concentration of sugar and dextran
                                impacted the behaviour of the sample during the analysis. We think that crystallization
                                of sugar might be responsible for this changing behaviour throughout time of the
                                rheological assay, but no further investigation was done since this behaviour was not
                                observed when adding buffer as a control for the experiment.</span>

                                characterized using micro-SNT enzymatic assays that revealed, in the condition of ropy
                                maple syrup (pH 6.5 and temperature between 15 and 20 °C), that the dextranase would be
