                        In the 2020 edition of aSAP, modeling helped us identify and study the theoretical behavior of
                        candidate enzymes. This year, that led to the experimental confirmation and characterization of
                        our chosen enzyme, a dextranase from <span class="italic">G. Algens.</span><br><br>
                        This evolution is a great example of how modeling has already helped us bridge the gap between
                        theory and practice within a short time frame, helping solve a problem that would have otherwise

                            In 2021, using modeling in a completely different way this time, we set our sights on
                            figuring out how aSAP would actually work in a real-world scenario. With our wet lab work
                            covering biochemistry and microbiology in the scientific sphere of our project, we wanted to
                            get a better grasp of its practical sphere: actually mixing our enzyme. This model would not
                            be molecular, as it was in 2020, but rather mechanical.

                            Maple syrup, defective or not, is stored in barrels that are then placed inside warehouses
                            managed by maple syrup organizations in Quebec, such as the <span class="italic">Producteurs
                                et productrices
                                acéricoles du Québec</span> (PPAQ, French for <span class="italic">Maple Producers of

                            We didn’t want to change the current processing and management of maple syrup barrels, since
                            the problem only concerns some of the barrels, the ones containing ropy maple syrup. Our
                            first approach to mix our enzyme with ropy maple syrup was to directly insert a mixer inside
                            the barrel. That would not change the processing chain of barrels, rather just add a new
                            step in the chain that would not require extracting the syrup to mix it.

                            That proved to be difficult because of the small diameter (around 5 cm<sup>1</sup>) of the
                            hole used to
                            fill barrels with maple syrup. A mechanical mixer strong enough to mix a viscous syrup, such
                            as ropy maple syrup, would hardly fit through such a small opening. Another point is that
                            the hole is not in the center of the barrel’s top, so it would also need to fold to pass
                            through the filling hole, then unfold inside the barrel to rotate at its center to
                            effectively mix the syrup (see Figure 1). This posed a problem for the mechanical capability
                            and effectiveness of the mixer.

                            However, in discussions with the PPAQ, we discovered that producers and organizations each
                            have their own storing barrels, meaning that maple syrup is transferred from a producer’s
                            barrel to a storing barrel used by said organizations. That sparked the idea to implement a
                            way for our enzymatic treatment to act during the transfer of the syrup between the two
                            barrels, as shown in the picture below. Once again, this would not add a new processing
                            chain, rather just a step in the current processing chain. Having solved the physical
                            implementation step, the next step was to find a mixing process with the help of modeling.

                            In order to model a realistic mixer, we needed knowledge on the existing mixers, parameters
                            to consider and modeling possibilities. With some research, we discovered the existence of
                            computational fluid dynamics (hereby referred to as CFD). However, among our student team
                            members, none had prior knowledge of CFD, since no one had been trained in mechanical or
                            chemical engineering. We therefore contacted and partnered up with Hossein, a chemical
                            engineering PhD student who helped us through all modeling steps.

                            A tank with an integrated mixer is used in our simulations because in a real scenario, ropy
                            syrup would be transferred from the producer’s barrel into a tank, then mixed with our
                            dextranase and finally transferred into another barrel for storing. See Figure 2.<br><br>

                            <br><br>
                            For the simulations, we used a ropy syrup viscosity of 1 Pa·s corresponding to the sample
                            #2. That viscosity score is 1000x higher than water. We wanted to test with the highest
                            viscosity to recreate a “worst-case scenario.” However, some ropy maple syrup may be even
                            more viscous than the samples we had access to. We made the assumption it would still
                            represent an accurate simulation of real mixing processes.
                            <br><br>
                            We used water to represent the enzyme in the simulations. This assumption is made
                            considering that the presence of the enzyme will not significantly modify the viscosity of
                            its vehicle. The vehicle will also contain other components such as ions and a buffer
                            solution rather than pure water. Again, we assume this will not alter the results
                            significantly considering the high ratio of ropy syrup / water viscosity.
                            <br><br>
                            Density of water is considered to be 998.2 kg/m<sup>3</sup> according to Ansys Fluent
                            library<sup>4</sup>. We set
                            maple syrup density at 1333 kg/m<sup>3</sup> by converting 67 Brix degrees (°Bx) to density
                            units.
                            Usual sugar concentration for maple syrup is 66°Bx, but syrup of 67°Bx is also made by
                            maple producers and slightly more viscous. We assumed regular or ropy maple syrup have the
                            same density, because producers monitor the boiling process of maple sap to aim for 66°Bx.
                            <br><br>
                            Lastly, all simulations were made in a two-dimensional environment due to Ansys Student
                            license limitations and to the lack of computational power (such as a calculation server).

                            Jet mixers require a continuous flow in order to have an effective mixing process. Since we
                            didn’t want to dilute ropy syrup any more than with the small quantity of the enzyme vehicle
                            required, we had to consider using the syrup inside the tank to create the mixing flow. In
                            order to test that, we simulated the mixing of ropy syrup with ropy syrup taken from the
                            tank and coming out of the jet nozzle. To compare the mixing effectiveness of the jet mixer
                            using a far less viscous fluid, we simulated water coming out of the jet nozzle. The
                            Simulation 1 indicates that the syrup-water (ambient-injected fluids) combination mixes far
                            better than the syrup-syrup combination. The flow pattern of the first combination shows a
                            rotation of the fluids throughout the tank instead of the push of one fluid by another in
                            the latter. Research also showed that the syrup-water combination is what is expected of jet
                            mixers, but not the syrup-syrup combination<sup>2</sup>.
                            <br><br>
                            These results made us realize that, in a practical situation, it would be hard to make ropy
                            syrup, a highly viscous fluid, get pushed out of a nozzle through another highly viscous
                            fluid. We couldn’t expect it to mix well enough for a small quantity of water (the enzyme
                            vehicle) to homogenize well throughout the tank. We then turned to a more standard mixing
                            approach in commercial uses: a paddle mixer.

                            The simulation 2 shows the two types of paddles studied. In these simulations, it is
                            important to know that the blue color not only represents the enzyme, but its trajectory.
                            When solid blue, this means that the enzyme has made contact with ropy syrup and is actively
                            reacting. Red shows that the enzyme has not yet made contact with ropy syrup. Knowing so, it
                            is easy to see higher turbulence with the cubic paddles, meaning better contact between the
                            enzyme and the syrup. The flat paddles produce a smooth mixing, leaving bigger unmixed areas
                            at the end of the simulation compared to cubic paddles.

                            Therefore, a paddle mixer using cubic paddles would be more efficient than one using flat
                            paddles.

                            <span class="limits">Limits: </span>We are aware of the limitations imposed by a 2D aspect
                            of a rotating impeller. The characteristics of 3D simulations are far more complicated and
                            time consuming. In case of a real world implementation, more accurate simulations will be
                            done. The purpose of these simulations was to test two types of researched and recommended
                            mixer models and propose a more suited model for further study.

                                As we established, we did not only use computing power to generate our results for the
                                modeling aspect of aSAP 2021. It also involved research, data gathering, substantial
                                learning and a lot of optimization to better represent what our project could offer in
                                terms of CFD simulations.

                                the most appropriate model to mix our enzyme with ropy maple syrup. After doing these
                                modeling experiments, we now have a much more solid idea of how aSAP can be implemented,
