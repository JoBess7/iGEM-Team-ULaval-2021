                                <br> 2020 was a challenging year. Due to COVID-19, the whole world had to adjust to a new lifestyle that came with its ups and down. We didn’t go to Boston for the Jamboree, but unexpectedly we got the chance to go further in our project by doing it in two years. aSAP is an initiative that is dear to our hearts and to be able to finish what we began last year in iGEM was a blessing. In fact, the team wanted to achieve more in terms of its human practices. 
                                <br><br> Last year, we were slowly discovering the challenges of our project. We began by choosing an issue that was related to our national treasure: maple syrup. Then, we thought about maple syrup and how to preserve and prosper this industry. Marie Filteau, a researcher at the Department of Food and Nutrition Sciences at Laval University, explained to us the microbiology, the impact of seasonal changes and the flavors of maple syrup along with other things. Jean-François Sénéchal, a teacher in the Department of Philosophy at Laval University helped us by giving us a series of questions that we should answer in order to have strong human practices. He talked about usefulness, justice, laws, responsability, sustainability, etc. 
                                <br><br> This made us realize that in order to answer those questions, we had to ask the people who are directly associated with maple syrup and who know its issues. We did a survey for maple syrup producers which helped us for our market research, because we analysed it later on. We created a survey for consumers, but we wanted to make it approuve by an ethical committee, so we waited until 2021. 
                                <br><br> At some point, we were divided between buddy and ropy syrup among other possibilities. Speaking to Luc Lagacé, representatives for the MAPAQ, Vincent Poisson, producers from the PPAQ, UPA and Jean-Michel Lavoie, we realized that buddy syrup was already tackled in the scientific sphere. At the end, we turned our attention to ropy syrup and the use of enzymes. Dextranase in the sugar industry and flavor defections were approached in the meantime. 
                                <br><br> Our ultimate project could be defined as the transformation or revalorisation of the waste of the maple syrup industry. More specifically, making a “ universal ” base product that can then be transformed into other products in the food industry was our goal. We did an interview with a national radio broadcasting, Radio-Canada, to diffuse our initiative to Canada. Each time we discuss with experts or organizations, we accumulate facts and statistics on the industry in general and on ropy syrup. More scientists were contacted like Dr Stéphane Gagné, Dr Patrick Lagüe, Dr Rong Shi, Dr Manon Couture and Dr Simon Hardy who are all professors of the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Bioinformatics of Laval University. They assisted us with the modelling aspect and design of the dextranase.
                                <br><br> What we wanted to do last year but couldn’t finish was the confidentiality agreement with the PPAQ to gain funding, resources and information for our project. We also wanted to release a survey for Canadian consumers which could help further our market research. In sum, we had pretty solid human practices in 2020, but we wanted to complete these two remaining points since we always finish what we start!

                                <br> Last year, we focused on the more local aspect of our project. We had in mind that if ropy syrup would affect people, it would clearly be those in Quebec since most of the production of maple syrup is done there. This year, we are back with the continuation of our project aSAP which stands for ‘’a solution against maple polymers’’. In agreement, aSAP 2.0 will have a more global spectrum by focusing on Canada as a whole, more than just the province of Quebec. With all that is happening right now, we found new challenges to face and we want to show the results of the experiments we intended to do in 2020. 
                                <br><br> 2021 is for us a fresh start! We are excited to show you the impact our ideas can have on the entire world. We prepared surveys, interviews with corporations and we discussed laws with government organizations or pioneers of the maple syrup industry. Our three main goals include innovation in the industry, responsible production and improvement of Canadian social cohesion.

                                <span class='subtitle'>Innovation in the Industry</span>
                                <br><br> Our project is both innovative for the iGEM competition and in real life since it’s the only initiative that tackles the maple syrup industry, specifically ropy maple syrup. We are one of few people in the world to try new technology, such as synthetic biology and biotechnology to innovate in this food industry. The originality can be seen in the fact that we are the first in the world to identify, study and characterize the biochemical properties of a new enzyme potentially usable under the specific conditions of ropy maple syrup. Actually, there are no solutions to ropy syrup let alone its revaluation.
                                <br><br> aSAP, therefore, represents a concrete alternative to a waste product that inevitably comes with economic potential. Indeed, maple syrup is an important aspect of the Canadian economy and of our patrimony. Our scientific project has the potential to preserve our maple groves and to reduce significant financial losses and considerable waste due to ropy maple syrup which is already responsible for the industry in Quebec only.
                                <br><br> By making aSAP a reality, we aim to bring equity by benefiting both small and large producers. We believe that all producers deserve to be able to produce a useful syrup worthy of the time and effort expended in its manufacture. 
                                <br><br><br>
                                <span class='subtitle'>Responsible production</span>
                                <br><br>Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, the 12th goal is to ‘’Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns’’. (United Nations, 2021). Our team thinks that responsible production can both be valuable in terms of environmental concerns, but also in terms of economics. Ropy maple syrup can be a financial strain on smaller producers. Indeed, they pay for unnecessary energy consumption and the disposal of the defective maple syrup still by making no profit at all. All of those actions do not benefit the environment. With global warming and the industrialization of the production process, the situation will get worse. 
                                <br><br>This is why we need to reduce waste for the environment’s sake because otherwise, ropy maple syrup is just thrown away. This can represent a significant amount of a year’s maple syrup production. With people starving in the world or not having electricity, it’s quite a big deal to waste food and energy at the same time. Food production is highly regulated. aSAP, which uses enzymatic methods to solve ropiness, seeks to impact Quebec’s legislation regarding the sale of derivative maple products and to raise awareness on the impact of not solving this issue.
